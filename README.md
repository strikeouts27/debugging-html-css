## Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` and `style.css` files in your favorite text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. Identify the errors in both files. Use tools like:

4. Resolve all identified errors in the `index.html` and `style.css` files by:
   - Commenting out the original error code.
   - Adding the corrected code directly below the commented-out error code.

   - Commit your changes and push them to your own GitHub repository.
   - Deploy the corrected project to GitHub Pages.

6. Submit your GitHub repository link and GitHub Pages link as instructed in the course.
